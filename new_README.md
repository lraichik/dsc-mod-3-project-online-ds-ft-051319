## Question 1
Does discount amount have a statistically significant effect on the quantity of a product in an order? If so, at what level(s) of discount?

Null Hypothosis: Discount does not affect quantity of product ordered
Alternative Hypthosis: Discount does effect the quantity of product ordered
Alpha: .05
### Results
We can reject the null hypothosis only with discounts of .01-.06, .15, .2 and .25 while with a 10% discount we can not reject the null hypothosis that it is not better then not having a discount
### Recommendations
I can recommend using .05%, .15%, .2% and .25% as discount amounts to try and drive sales.
.05% discounts have a smaller but still statistically significant effect, while .15-.25% discounts have a bigger effect.
I would also suggest further work looking into 10% discounts to see if more can be found out about it

## Question 2
Which product sells the best per order? Also which are the top 5 products sold per order?

H0 = all quantity of each product sold per order, means are equal
Ha = all quantity of each product sold per order, means are not equal
alpha = .05
### Results
The only one that seems to be better then the others with a power signifigance over 80 is the product number 60, which as can be seen below has the highest total ordered and the highest mean per order.
16 and 31 may also be good ones, the power on them is in the 70's, the signifigance is all with at least 95% signifigance
### Recommendations
I would suggest the company focus on 60,16 and 31 as they seem to be the best preforming

I also would suggest further work in looking into the other products on these 2 lists as well

## Question 3
Are any categories changing in sales from month to month?

H0 = each category sold same quantity’s per month
Ha = each category sold different quantity’s per month
alpha = .05
### Results
It appears p1, p3, p4 and p8 are the ones that have the most positive change, this also shows on the graph below as the 4 that have a more positive rate of change

### Recommendations
I would suggest focusing on seeing what other products can be sold in categories 1,3,4,8 and at the same time try to get better at selling in the other categories 2,5,6,7

<details><summary>Question 4</summary>
    
## Question 4
Which employees sell the most, by dollar amount?

HO = All employees mean per sale is the same
Ha = Employees mean per sale is different
Alpha = .05
### Results
There does not seem to be a best employee based on the p-values and the power levels as well as the small effect sizes.

### Recommendations
There does not seem to be a best employee based on the p-values and the power levels as well as the small effect sizes.
This is even though the prior ANOVA test showed that they do have differeneces in means.
I can not make any recommendations based on this information except to try and do further work into this with a different testing method as there seems to be differences that I may not have been able to figure out with hypothosis testing.
