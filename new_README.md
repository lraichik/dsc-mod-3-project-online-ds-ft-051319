## Question 1
Does discount amount have a statistically significant effect on the quantity of a product in an order? If so, at what level(s) of discount?

Null Hypothosis: Discount does not affect quantity of product ordered
Alternative Hypthosis: Discount does effect the quantity of product ordered
Alpha: .05
### Results
We can reject the null hypothosis only with discounts of .01-.06, .15, .2 and .25 while with a 10% discount we can not reject the null hypothosis that it is not better then not having a discount
### Recommendations
I can recommend using .05%, .15%, .2% and .25% as discount amounts to try and drive sales.
.05% discounts have a smaller but still statistically significant effect, while .15-.25% discounts have a bigger effect.
I would also suggest further work looking into 10% discounts to see if more can be found out about it

## Question 2
Which product sells the best per order? Also which are the top 5 products sold per order?

H0 = all quantity of each product sold per order, means are equal
Ha = all quantity of each product sold per order, means are not equal
alpha = .05
### Results
The only one that seems to be better then the others with a power signifigance over 80 is the product number 60, which as can be seen below has the highest total ordered and the highest mean per order.
16 and 31 may also be good ones, the power on them is in the 70's, the signifigance is all with at least 95% signifigance
### Recommendations
I would suggest the company focus on 60,16 and 31 as they seem to be the best preforming

I also would suggest further work in looking into the other products on these 2 lists as well
